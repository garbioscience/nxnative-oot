# The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Switch 2 (0400486024DEC000): the rewriter's patches of this game's own builds. dm/tools/patch_nso.py loads every profile's patches.py and applies
# those of a module's NSO build ID; CUTS, OBS and FRAME_STEP as described there ("Registered patches"). Patches of Nintendo SDK module builds are in dm/tools/sdk_patches.py
CUTS = {
  # v131072 main: the movie player's video enhancement. Creating a movie player (main+0x3b5f500), the game takes the enhanced player (0x2f0 bytes, main+0x3b62cd0, then the NDVE setup
  # main+0x3b62ea0) when its NDVE manager is ready ([x0+0x460] set and its +0x10 not 0), else the plain one (0x1c0 bytes, main+0x3b619e0). The enhanced player runs an Ampere tensor network
  # (Movie/Ndve/Ndve-Nvn2-vid_seq5.dat: 14 compute dispatches a movie frame, 465 HMMA and 1,005 subgroup shuffles a thread in its largest) that took 47.5 ms of GPU time a frame on an
  # M-series Mac, against a 16.7 ms frame: the movies ran at 20 fps. A workaround for that platform limit (the HMMA chains are open in docs/reference/shaders.md, "Ampere HMMA through
  # simdgroup_matrix"): the branch always takes the plain player, which shows the decoded 1920x1080 picture as it is
